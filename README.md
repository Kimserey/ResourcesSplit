# Resources Split

An application to split resources based on Level and Continent.

## The partitioning strategy

Each level has a score attributed 1-2-3. A resource is placed where:

 1. The total Level score is the lowest is chosen
 2. When multiple groups have the same Level score, the first group with the least resource on the Continent of the resource target is chosen


Select the level and continent which matches the resources
